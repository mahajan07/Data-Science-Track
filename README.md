Learning how to leverage a software tool to visualize data will also enable you to extract information, better understand the data, and make more effective decisions. The main goal of this Data Visualization with Python course is to teach you how to take data that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that makes sense to people. Various techniques have been developed for presenting data visually but in this course, we will be using several data visualization libraries in Python, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.

Deep Learning with TensorFlow
ABOUT THE COURSE
This Deep Learning with TensorFlow course focuses on TensorFlow. If you are new to the subject of deep learning, consider taking our Deep Learning 101 course first.
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement deep learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressional, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning.

In this TensorFlow course, you will be able to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations, and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple “Hello World” example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification, and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained. Finally, the course covers different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks, and Autoencoders.
